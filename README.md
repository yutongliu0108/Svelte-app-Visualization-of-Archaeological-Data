# Interactive Visualization of Archaeological Data from the OCHRE API

This project is a Svelte-based web application that integrates data from the OCHRE API to visualize archaeological spatial units through interactive tables and maps. Users can browse, filter, and explore detailed information on archaeological items. The app features dynamic routes, search filters, and a professional UI, and is deployed privately via Vercel. Key tools used include Svelte, OCHRE SDK, MapLibre, Shadcn-svelte components, and Tailwind CSS.
